Any files present in the container image at /opt/storage will be symlinked
to $WORKSPACE/storage at startup.

Files in $WORKSPACE/storage will then be linked/unlinked as defined in
/opt/storage_monitor/etc/mappings.sh as they are added/moved/removed.

This is where you should add models and datasets if you would like to bundle them.
